//! If any validation errors occurred, some settings may have been reverted to defaults.

//! This is because there can only be one component with type "fullscreen" in the list of components which we want to display

//! This is since we currently use the same logic to navigate to a component that isn't necessarily an overlay

//! We also add any additional properties that were missing from the stored settings (could be newly added settings, or which we never save to storage to avoid clutter)
